# National Urban Green Cover
## NDVI Trend Analysis for Indian Cities (2010–2023)

## 🌱 Introduction to NDVI

**NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)** is a satellite-derived index that quantifies the presence and health of vegetation. It is calculated using the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs):

NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)

NDVI values range from -1 to +1:
- Values close to **+1** indicate **dense, healthy vegetation**.
- Values near **0** suggest **barren areas** (rock, sand, urban land).
- Negative values usually indicate **water bodies** or clouds.

This makes NDVI an essential metric for tracking green cover trends in urban landscapes, especially over time and across seasons.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project offers a detailed visual and statistical analysis of urban green cover trends in **ten major Indian cities** from **2010 to 2023**, based on monthly NDVI values. The centerpiece is an interactive multi-page **Power BI dashboard**, built to transform raw satellite-derived data into actionable insights.

The dashboard serves **urban planners, environmental researchers, policymakers, and data enthusiasts**, enabling them to:
- Track greenness over time
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Compare cities
- Investigate the impact of urban development on vegetation

## 🧩 Key Metrics & Concepts

- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):** Primary measure of vegetation density.
- **Seasonality:** Analysis of how NDVI changes during different months of the year.
- **Year-over-Year (YoY) Change:** Tracks long-term gains or losses in green cover.
